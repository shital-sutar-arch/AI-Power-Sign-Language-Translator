**# AI-Power-Sign-Language-Translator
<br>
AI Power Sign Language Translator that translates Signs with voice given by the user.
<br>
The AI Power Sign Language Translator is an innovative project designed to bridge the communication gap between individuals who use sign language and those who do not. This project uses advanced AI  techniques to translate sign language gestures into spoken language, enabling seamless interaction.
<br>
Key Features:
<br>
Real-Time Translation: Converts sign language gestures into text and voice in real time.
<br>
Speech Integration: Outputs translations as audio for improved accessibility.
<br>
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive and interactive platform to upload videos or use live camera input.
<br>
Custom Dataset Support: Train the model further with new sign language datasets.
<br>

Purpose and Goals:
<br>
1. Empower Communication: Help individuals with hearing or speech impairments communicate more effectively.
<br>
2. Leverage AI: Use machine learning to recognize and interpret sign language accurately.
<br>
3. Accessibility: Ensure inclusivity by enabling non-sign-language users to understand gestures easily.
<br>
4. Expand Usability: Create a system that supports multiple languages and gestures.
<br>
Technologies Used
<br>
Frontend:
HTML/JavaScript: For building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
<br>
Webcam Integration: To capture gestures in real time.
<br>
Backend:
<br>
Flask: To handle API requests for gesture recognition and translation.
<br>
Machine Learning Model: A CNN trained on sign language datasets for gesture interpretation.
<br>

AI and Machine Learning
<br>
TensorFlow: For model training and prediction.
<br>
OpenCV: For image preprocessing and gesture recognition.
<br>
How It Works
1. Capture Gesture: The user can use the live webcam.
<br>
2. Gesture Processing:
<br> 
The video feed is divided into individual frames.
<br>
Each frame is processed using AI-based gesture recognition.
<br>
3. Translation: Recognized gestures are mapped to corresponding text or speech using a trained model.
<br>
4. Output: The translated result is displayed as text and played as audio.
